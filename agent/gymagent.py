        The action distribution is actually a second order

        Such truth value, called the action truth value, corresponds
        to the second order probability of acheiving the goal if the
        action is taken right now.

          <P>

        is the set of all subjective paths compatible with <P>, and a
        subjective path is a sequence of sujective states (atomspace
        snapshots) indexed by time.

        In order to infer such action truth value one needs to perform
        deduction (or modus ponens) on the cognitive schematics,
        combining the probability of the context being currently true.

        # context to be true and multiply it by the truth value of the

        # https://github.com/ngeiswei/papers/blob/master/PartialBetaOperatorInduction/PartialBetaOperatorInduction.pdf
        # and use it to perform a Bayesian Model Averaging to obtain
        # the second order distribution of each action.
        #
        # Important Notes:

        # 1. Adding an unknown component (with flat or such prior) in
        #    the BMA can flatten the resulting distribution and be
        #    used to user-tune exploration vs exploitation in a
        #    justified manner. This is probably equivalent to (or
        #    better than) Epsilon-best. Ultimately the weight of such
        #    unknown component should be calculated as the unknown
        #    rest in the Solomonoff mixture.
        #
        # 2. We actually don't need to build the mixture model, rather
        #    we just need to hand the convex combination of models to
        #    the decide function which will do the Thompson sampling.
        #
        # 3. It's unclear if the probability of the context should
        #    altern the model TV or its weight. We need to think of
        #    generalizing the inactive models as well.

        # For now discretize context truth into valid and invalid and
        # only consider valid cognitive schematics in the BMA
        # (Bayesian Model Averaging). It's not entirely clear what to
        # do with the invalid cognitive schematics, maybe they should
