# Chase Malmo

## Description

Port of chase for Malmo.  Food pellets are replaced by diamonds.

## Status

It should work.  Though as a close alternative, you may find a jupyter
notebook file `02_minerl_navigate_agent.ipynb` under the project
folder which relies on `minerl`.

## Usage

1. Clone malmo https://github.com/Microsoft/malmo

   Note: No need to compile malmo as a pre-built version (MalmoPython)
   has been included under `../../rocca/malmo`. Only install the required
   dependencies to launch minecraft.

2. Launch `<MALMO>/Minecraft/launchClient.sh`.

3. Launch chase malmo `python chase_malmo.py`.
